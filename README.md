A game to have fun and pass some time in which you are a spaceship and have to eliminate as much aliens as possible in the given time. The number of enemies increases and you will get additional time based on your score.

## How to play:

You can move all over the map with the arrow keys (wasd is available as well). Aliens spawn randomly and you have to use your bullets (space button) to take them out. Remember that you can NOT shoot twwo bullets at a time (if you press space while there is another bullet on the display, the previous bullet will disappear and replaced with the new one, so spamming is not allowed!)

## Is there an end to the game?

The answer is NO! the point of this game is to have fun and get as high score as you can in a short time. The rounds are not long, but they are really exciting and perfect to pass some time!

## Are there going to be updates in the future?
YES! there will be more updates and potential bug fixes in the future to make the game experience much better.
